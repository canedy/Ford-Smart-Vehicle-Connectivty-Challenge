## Inspiration
As a technologist, I am always interested in how digital technology can make our lives better. When Ford launched the hackathon, I saw the chance to learn more about the workings of my Ford F150 and solve the nuisance problem of waiting in my truck for businesses to provide me products and services.  My interest in the project intensified when I saw the work being done by the automotive industry in Vehicle Digitial Identity (VDI).

## What it does
Integrated Sign-In Autonomous Automated Check-In (ISAAC) is a vehicle tracking, and authentication application businesses can use to improve their tracking, delivery/pickup process, and customer experience. Ford owners will not only see ISAAC as a concierge that reduces the friction caused by businesses not knowing when they will arrive to receive or deliver products and services but authenticates who they are.

## How we built it
When I looked at available resources and the timeline of the hackathon, I decided to use low code / no-code technology to develop the application.  This technology allowed me to spend more time on the design flow of the application and use standardized components for coding.

## Challenges we ran into
There were four challenges in producing the application:
The source I used to develop the application requires authentication. I was not able to create a workaround for this requirement.
The app was not autonomous. It required communication between a customer and a business, so an e-commerce portal was created. 
The application requires movement to monitor the vehicle's location.   A simulator of the car moving had to be developed.
Connection is a link between Integromat and Ford Connect API with OAuth to handle token exchange automatically.

 ## Accomplishments that we are proud of
The most exciting part of the project was to engage with Ford 150. Using my computer to start my truck was a wow moment. Knowing that this type of work is the first step for determining use cases for technology like digital vehicle identification makes you feel good. That said, developing technology to make a person's life a little smoother is a big deal.

## Tooling
Used no-code/low-code solution to develop the concept for faster prototyping. 
Glideapps - The program used to develop frontend applications fast and at scale

Integromat - Integromat lets you connect apps and automate workflows in a few clicks. Move data between apps without effort so you can focus on growing your business.

Mapbox - Maps and location for developers

## What we learned
 Probably the biggest thing I learned was the opportunities being developed around Vehicle digital Identification (VDI).

## What's next for ISAAC - Integrated Sign in Autonomous Automated Check-in
Development, commercial uses like providing vehicle location information to personal devices and equipment in the area. Using the app to improve retailer's customer experience between the location and their vehicle.
